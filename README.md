Road Accident Dashboard on different weather conditions.

I am excited to share with you our latest data analysis project focusing on road accidents. Through meticulous data collection and analysis, we have compiled valuable insights to enhance road safety measures and reduce accidents.

Our Excel dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of road accident data, including trends, hotspots, contributing factors, and more. With interactive visualizations and user-friendly interface, stakeholders can easily explore the data and identify areas for intervention.

This project underscores our commitment to leveraging data-driven approaches for addressing real-world challenges. I encourage you to explore the dashboard and engage in discussions to drive impactful decision-making and improve road safety outcomes.

Thank you for your attention and collaboration on this initiative.
